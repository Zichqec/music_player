# Music Player
## A music player for ukagaka, written in YAYA

This music player is free to use within your own ghost projects. All I ask is that you credit me in your ghost's readme for it! I can be credited as Zichqec, with the following link: https://ukagaka.zichqec.com/

I'd appreciate if you left the credit in the help menu as well.

There are instructions for how to integrate it into your ghost within the dic file. Please read them carefully.

If there are any issues, please contact me or open an issue.
